      is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images.
    In traditional animation,
    images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets
    to be photographed and exhibited on film.</p>
    <p style= "margin-top:40px;">Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI).
    Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation,
    while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons,
    low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings.
    Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique
    to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutout
    puppets or clay figures.</p>
